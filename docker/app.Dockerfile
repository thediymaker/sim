# the version is kept in lockstep with the `isolated-vm` pin in
# apps/sim/package.json — Node 24 (ABI 137) requires isolated-vm 6.x.
#
# Only what the running container needs belongs here. ffmpeg backs the media
# subprocess adapter; python3 is the node-gyp interpreter and is kept because
# build-base inherits from this stage. The compiler toolchain lives in build-base
# so the runner does not ship it.

#
# node-gyp comes from the lockfile, not `npx`. It is a devDependency of apps/sim
# purely so `turbo prune` keeps it: the only other copy is transitive through
# `@electron/rebuild`, which belongs to apps/desktop and is pruned away. `npx`
# resolved it from the registry at build time, which pulled a different major
# (13.x vs the pinned 12.4.0) and bypassed the `minimumReleaseAge` supply-chain
# gate in bunfig.toml on every production image build.
#
# This stage contains only the pruned workspace manifests, while the full lockfile
# still describes every workspace. Bun must be allowed to normalize that lockfile
# to the pruned graph; the full-repository CI install owns frozen-lockfile validation.
